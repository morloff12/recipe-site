,"description": "If buttery, tender, sweet poached flavor is what you&#39;re after, there&#39;s no better way to cook it than sous vide. It&#39;s also more foolproof than boiling or steaming, and affords the opportunity to infuse that lobster meat with extra flavor. Think: lobster with the butter built right into it. Doesn&#39;t that sound swell?"

I have to say, so far I have made Kenji's sous vide chicken breast, rib eye and tonight I'm doing the lobster. I own the Anova and really didn't know how amazing it really is until I stumbled on Kenji's sous vide recipes. \n\nFunny- I have a friend who is super old school about grilling his steaks. I actually challenged him to a grilling vs sous vide cook off- I'll let you know the results if we ever get around to it. By the way- I will never turn down a perfectly grilled steak either. It amuses me how judgy people are on these posts. Peace!"

Neither involved cooking ingredients sous-vide. \n\nI'm with @erallison on this one. I have an Anova precision cooker and I use it fairly regularly as a home cook. You're complaining about a recipe that uses what is essentially the next microwave oven for home cooks. Not to mention that the recipe is from a column with the tagline \"Unraveling the mysteries of home cooking through science with J. Kenji L&#243;pez-Alt,\" which I expect to be more technical and use new technology by its own mandate. I don't use my microwave for everything, and I don't sous-vide everything, but I want to see recipes and articles on how to use both of those tools effectively. \n\nOn top of that, it's unfair to give this recipe a 1-star review when you're never going to make it and disagree with it on principle alone. That's like if I gave Citizen Kane a 1-star review because I don't watch black and white movies."

There's a lot of baking, pasta, cookies and drinks stuff as of late and only a few SV items. \n\nAnd why is everyone bitching about the Anova sponsored content - did you folks make your subscription payment to SE this month? Oh there is no cost, but lots of bills. That lobster, cookies and nice booze don't get there for free. \n\nLots of contributors here on SE that I'm sure love to have some income or at least foot the bill for the great stuff we get for free...

As it turns out, the sous vide is one of the most-used items in my kitchen (and has been for over a year)...not because it complicates things, but because it simplifies them. It's comparable to a microwave. Put something in a bag, set the temp, set a timer...done, perfectly. It takes all of the guess work out of a recipe, which to me was always the complicated part. I don't see it as an \"unnecessary gizmo\" anymore...it's a staple cooking tool. As a home cook, I highly recommend it."
